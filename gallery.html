                    <figcaption>This is an example of handwritten calculations for Computer Assembly code. There are
                        some
                        conversion math and keeping track of values in each register.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>In this assembly code execution, the system randomly generated a set of number from a
                        limited range. It also ordered the numbers and counted how many instances of each number.

                    <figcaption>As a Kinesiology major, I was able to explore different tools to calculate muscle mass
                        and fat mass.
                        I find these different instruments of tracking exercise progress very fascinating.

                    <figcaption>In my free time, I learned how to make videos on Final Cut Pro. I liked how you can
                        adjust different features or add things to enhance your videos.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>I was determined to learn machine learning, and it turned to a much more ambitious
                        endeavor than I initially imagined.
                        I had to first learn python and then learn how machine learning models works. In this picture,
                        it shows a few of the many submissions I revised to improve my model.
                        The lower the score, the more accurate the model. This was for the Housing Prices Competition in
                        Kaggle.

                    <figcaption>I accidentally ripped my favorite pair of jeans at work. I decided to hand sew them back
                        together since it is too small to fit in my sewing machine.
                        Furthermore, I used a water bottle to help hold its shape and to provide a better surface for me
                        to sew on.

                    <figcaption>This is a portfolio project for class using object-oriented programming. We had to
                        simulate a game of Othello in python.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>I didn't like the bottom cut of these jeans, so I hemmed it up a little using my sewing
                        machine to better fit my style. </figcaption>

                    <figcaption>I interned for a startup that was part of HAX Shenzhen, China during my Capstone
                        program. This is outside of Huaqiangbei's electronics market.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>I did my Chinese Capstone project on Osteoporosis. My presentation was in Chinese and it
                        was recorded. This is a picture of one of the most important bones of the body: the skull.
