                <h3>Web Servers</h3>
                <!-- Explain what index means as it relates to websites and servers-->
                <p>In websites and servers, the word <strong>index</strong> is used conventionally as the default name
                    for an HTML
                    file.
                    When a URL is typed in ending with "/" into a browser, and it doesn't specify which HTML document,
                    it will
                    automatically go to "/index.html"
                </p>

                <!--Explain can be seen in the browser's Web Dev/Inspector tools. What is different about the file's details on the web server versus the local computer?-->
                <p>There are many differences between the file's <strong>network details</strong> on the web server
                    versus the local
                    computer.
                    Things like the request URL, favicon, connection, server information, host, and cookies may be
                    different.
                    For example, the URL will normally start with "file://" if it comes from a local computer, and
                    "https://" if it
                    is from
                    a web server.
                </p>

                <!--Explain why the favicon.ico file has a status 200, but the main.css and main.js files do not.-->
                <p>The favicon.ico file has a <strong>status 200</strong> number for this webpage, but the main.css and
                    main.js
                    files do not. The
                    favicon.ico file is a successful request. The main.css and main.js files return the <strong>404
                        status
                        code</strong>, which means
                    the files
                    are not found. There were no main.css and main.js files in the file folder, so the 404 status code
                    is
                    a proper
                    response. </p>

                <!--Explain the parts of the URL to your web file. What are the scheme, subdomain, host domain, and resources?-->
                <p>The <strong>scheme</strong> is "HTTPS". The <strong>host</strong> is "web.engr.oregonstate.edu". The
                    <strong>subdomain</strong> is "web.engr". The
                    <strong>host domain</strong> is "oregonstate.edu".
                    The <strong>resources</strong> are "/~yangnan/a1-yangnan/". In other words, this URL is accessing
                    the oregonstate.edu
                    server in the yangnan folder, and is currently on the a1-yangnan page.

            <article id="frontend-design">
                <h3>Frontend Design</h3>
                <p><strong>Frontend design</strong> refers to the design of an app or website that the target users will
                    be interacting with. Frontend design is essential to the user's impression of a product. A uniformed
                    frontend
                    design will use colors in the same family and the same fonts/icons throughout the different pages.
                    It should also be easy to
                    navigate or interact with different parts of the system.
                </p>
                <p>There are <strong>five E's of usability</strong> that are crucial to good frontend design:</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt><strong>Effective</strong></dt>
                    <dd>A usable website is effective, which means that the user is able to do the
                        things
                        they want to do on the website.</dd>
                    <dt><strong>Efficient</strong></dt>
                    <dd>A usable website is efficient, which means that the user is able to reach their
                        goal quickly without too much work.</dd>
                    <dt><strong>Easy to Navigate</strong></dt>
                    <dd>A usable website is easy to navigate, which means that new users can easily
                        understand how the website works and knows where to go to reach their goal.</dd>
                    <dt><strong>Error-Free</strong></dt>
                    <dd>A usable website is error-free, which means that inappropriate/unexpected
                        responses
                        from the website does not occur. The users shouldn't get stuck in their attempt to complete a
                        goal.
                    </dd>
                    <dt><strong>Enjoyable</strong></dt>
                    <dd>A usable website is enjoyable or <strong>engaging</strong>, which means that
                        the
                        user is not having a bad time on the website. Conversely, an enjoyable website may positively
                        relate
                        to its content and leave a good impression on its users.</dd>
                </dl>

                <p>The <strong>page layout tags</strong> are essential to web design because it helps break up the
                    content in more digestible pieces. Page layout tags allow different subject matters to be in their
                    own sections. It also allows the users to navigate or access certain elements with ease.
                    The <strong>header</strong> element usually holds the name of the website and does not normally
                    change from
                    page-to-page.
                    There can also be a <strong>nav</strong> element that can be used to easily navigate to other pages
                    of the website.
                    The <strong>main</strong> element frequently holds the whole content body of the page and is
                    separate
                    from the header,
                    nav, and footer elements.
                    You can section off parts of the main element with a <strong>section</strong> element and have
                    <strong>article</strong> elements
                    within the section to further
                    differentiate blocks of content. Lastly, there is a <strong>footer</strong> element that typically
                    shows up at
                    the
                    bottom of the page to hold
                    small print items like legal/contact information or links. These different page layout tags can help
                    search engine robots locate which area of the page may consist of a certain type of content.
                </p>
                <p>One vital feature of web design is <strong>anchor</strong> elements. Anchor tags allow the user to
                    jump to a different thing when the user clicks on it.

                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Anchors can link the user to an <strong>external content</strong>, or other websites, by
                        creating a hyperlink. This is frequently accomplished by using an <strong>absolute
                            path</strong>.
                        An absolute path contains all the
                        parts to a complete URL to direct the user to the right resource.
                    </li>
                    <li>Anchors can also link the user to <strong>internal contents</strong>, or different parts within
                        a file/page with the
                        section's ID value.</li>
                    <li>Anchors can also link the user from <strong>page-to-page</strong>, or to different parts within
                        relative
                        directories. This can be accomplished by using a <strong>relative URL</strong>. A relative URL
                        does not contain all parts
                        of a complete URL, but sufficient parts of the URL in relation to the current file to reach the
                        needed
                        file. </li>
                </ol>

            <article id="optimized-images">
                <h3>Optimized Images</h3>
                <p>
                    There are ways to <strong>optimize images</strong> for the web. There are six major specifications
                    of
                    images to keep in mind when designing a website.
                    First, it should have a <strong>descriptive file name</strong> to help increase search engine
                    optimization (<strong>SEO</strong>). This improves search engine's
                    ability to find an image and categorize it properly for people searching for the image. It also
                    helps
                    understand what the image is. Secondly, images should have
                    a <strong>small file size</strong> to minimize loading time. The page should display high resolution
                    images only when necessary. Ideally, the developer should use
                    <strong>lossless compression</strong> to compress the image to a small size, since it does not
                    decrease
                    the visual quality of the image. Thirdly, the image should have
                    <strong>exact dimensions</strong> that are complimentary to the screen size. If the image is too
                    big,
                    then it will load too slowly. Conversely, if the image is too small,
                    it may potentially look a bit off. Fourthly, the images should be the <strong>correct file
                        format</strong>. Each file format has its pros and cons. Generally, photos are saved as .JPG and
                    Line-art images or animations are recommended to be saved as .GIF. Line art can be saved as 8-bit
                    .PNG.
                    Graphics with true transparency are best saved as at 24-bit .PNG.
                    Also, images should have a <strong>reduced resolution</strong>. People have different monitors, and
                    they
                    render different amounts of pixels per inch(ppi). Therefore, providing different
                    image sizes to match the different resolutions is favorable. Lastly, the <strong>color mode</strong>
                    for
                    the type of image file is also important. RGB is widely used for .JPG, .SVG, .PNG, and .WebP.
                    GIF files are indexed colored.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most appropriate file formats for photos are .JPG and .WebP. WebP and .JPG files can be
                    compressed
                    to a small size while keeping
                    a good image quality. The most appropriate file formats for line art are .GIF and .PNG.

            <article id="favicons">
                <h3>Favicons</h3>
                <p>
                    The little icon you see on a browser tab for a website or for an app or a company logo is a
                    <strong>favicon</strong>, also known
                    favorites icon, or touch icons. Favicons is a good way to identify and differentiate webpages from
                    each other. Browsers and devices
                    uses favicon files for bookmarks, favorites lists, app icons, and search engine results.

            <article id="css">
                <h3>Cascading Stylesheets</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Stylesheets</strong> are a powerful tool to incorporate in websites and apps. It allows the
                    developer to
                    harmoniously change the appearance of multiple webpages to look congruent using one stylesheet.
                    Stylesheets can also help improve the usability and readability of the page. Developers can use
                    stylesheets to
                    better represent brands and its image. Stylesheets allow the developer to adjust many
                    parts of a webpage or tags efficiently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are 5 ways to incorporate styles.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Styles can be linked to an <strong>External CSS</strong>. The .css file can be linked in the
                        global head of
                        the .html file.
                        <dl>
                            Ex. &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="App.css" />
                        </dl>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Styles can be <strong>embedded</strong> within a &lt;style> tag.
                        <dl>Ex. &lt;style> p {color: red;} &lt;/style></dl>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Styles can be <strong>inline</strong> with in an element.
                        <dl>Ex. &lt;p style="color:red"></dl>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Styles can be in written in <strong>JavaScript</strong> within a function.
                        <dl> Ex. const redParagrah = styled.p` <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;color: red;
                            <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;`;
                        </dl>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Styles can be in <strong>regular JavaScript</strong> through Document Object Model(DOM).
                        <dl>
                            Ex. document.getElementsByTageName('p').style.color='red';
